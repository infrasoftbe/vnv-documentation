# 📦 Depedencies

Centralized Dependency Export

<hr/>

## 🧠 What is this file?

The depts.ts file serves as a centralized entry point for all major external and internal dependencies used throughout the project.

Rather than importing dependencies from their original paths in every file, we group and re-export them here, under a single unified module. This improves maintainability, readability, and scalability of the codebase.

<hr/>

### 🚀 Why is it useful?
  - ✅ Simplified imports: Avoid deep or repetitive import paths across the codebase.
  - 🧹 Cleaner project structure: Centralizes third-party and internal module references.
  - 🛠️ Easy updates: If a library path changes or is swapped out, only one file needs to be updated.
  - 🧭 Better navigation: Developers can quickly see all major dependencies in one place.

🔧 How to use it

Thanks to a Webpack/Vite alias (@depts), any file in the project can import dependencies like this:

```typescript
import { uuid, vvComponents, vvAPI, vvExcel } from '@depts';
```

:::warning
***No need to write:***

```typescript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import { Button } from '@infrasoftbe/infrasoft-ui-components';
import { fetchSomething } from '@infrasoftbe/infrasoft-vnv-api-kit';
```
